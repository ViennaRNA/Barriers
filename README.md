`barriers` - Compute local minima and energy barriers of a landscape

## INSTALLATION

Typically, `barriers` in installed like this:

```[bash]
 ./configure
 ./make
 ./make install
```

The `barriers` program uses a large static array for the hash table at the
heart of the method. The size of this hash and therefore the maximum size
of the landscape you can analyse is set at compile time using the
`--with-hash-bits` option of the configure script, e.g.:
```[bash]
 ./configure --with-hash-bits=27
```
will create a hash of 2^27 entries.

If you you need a hash size >2^27 you may have to set the `-mcmodel=medium`
or `-mcmodel=large` option in `gcc`, e.g.:
```[bash]
 ./configure --with-hash-bits=29 CFLAGS='-mcmodel=medium'
```

You can use the script `scripts/get_hashbits.pl` to optimize the hashsize
given your RAM size and sequence length.
