.SH NAME
barriers \- Compute local minima and energy barriers of a landscape
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B barriers
.RI [ options ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBbarriers\fP reads an energy sorted list of conformations of a landscape,
and computes local minima and energy barriers of the landscape. For RNA
secondary structures, suitable input is produced by \fBRNAsubopt\fP. For each
local minimum found it prints to stdout, the conformation of the minimum,
its energy, the number of the "parent"-minimum it merges with, and the
height of the energy barrier. Additional information on each minimum, such
as saddle point conformation and basin sizes can be included via options.
A PostScript drawing of the resulting tree is written to "tree.ps" in the
current directory.
.SH OPTIONS
\fBbarriers\fP accepts the following options:
.TP
.BR  -q , " --quiet" , " --silent"
Be quiet, don't do PostScript output.
.TP
.B  -v, --verbose
Print more information.
.TP
.B \-h, \-\-help
Show summary of options.
.TP
.B \-V, \-\-version
Show version of program.
.TP
.B \-\-bsize
Print the size of of each basin in output (default: off).
.TP
.B \-c, \-\-connected
Check if landscape is connected. Skip rates computation if landscape is
disconnected (default: off).
.TP
.B \-\-max num
Compute only the lowest \fInum\fP local minima (default: 100).
.TP
.B \-\-minh delta
Print only minima with energy barrier greater than \fIdelta\fP (default: 0.000001).
.TP
.B \-\-saddle
Print the saddle point conformations in output (default: off).
.TP
.B \-\-rates
Compute rates between macro states (basins) for use with treekin. Two files
are written, "rates.out" containing the rates in ASCII format and
"rates.bin" in binary form (default: off).
.TP
.B \-T temp
Set temperature in centigrade. Used to compute Boltzmann fators in
conjunction with --rates (default: 37). 
.TP
.B \-\-poset n
Input landscape is a poset with n objective functions (default: off).
.TP
.B \-P l1=l2
Compute a minimal barrier path between local minima \fIl1\fP and
\fIl2\fP. The result will be written to the file "path.l1.l2.txt"
.TP
.B \--mapstruc filename
Once the barrier tree (and optionally rates) are constructed , read
stuctures from filename and map them to their corresponding minima (macro
states). Output is written to file "mapstruc.out" in the following form:
.br
gradient_min index_in_subopt energy basin truebasin gradient_basin
true_grad_basin
.br
The last number is probably what you want, true basins are those that
fulfill the minh criterium.
.TP
.B \-G graph
Set the type of configuration space, where \fIgraph\fP can be one of:
.br
.nf
RNA		RNA secondary structures (default)
RNA-noLP	canonical RNA structures (i.e. without isolated pairs)
Q2		Spin glass (strings of "+-")
Q\fIa\fP	\fIa\fP-letter hamming graph (e.g. Q3 strings of "ABC"). 
T		Phylogenetic Trees in bracket notation, e.g.
		((1)(((2)(3))(5))(4))
P		Permutations (as comma separated list), e.g.
		5,1,4,2,3
.br	
.fi
The type of landscape may also be set by the input file using the
fourth word on first line. E.g.:
.br
AUCGUGAGCUGUGUAGCUUAGCUAGCUAGC -610 100 :: RNA-noLP
.br
for an landscape of canonical RNA structures.
.TP
.B \-M move-set
Set the moveset for generating neighbors of a configuration. For RNA
possible values are \fInoShift\fP (default), \fIShift\fP or
\fIligand\fP. For Permutations possibilities are, \fIT\fP for
transpositions (default), \fIC\fP for canonical transpositions, and \fIR\fP
for reversal moves. Spin Glass always uses point mutations (single spin
flip), Trees use NNI (Nearest Neighbour Interchange).
