For ian explanation of the algorithm, please see 

Ch. Flamm, I.L. Hofacker, P.F. Stadler, M.T. Wolfinger. Barrier trees of degenerate landscapes.

And now some useful information:

The barriers program uses a large static array for the hash table at the heart of the method.
The size of this hash and therefore the maximum size of the landscape you can analyse is set at 
compile time using the --with-hash-bits option of the configure script.
E.g.:
	./configure --with-hash-bits=27
will create a hash of 2^27 entries 

If you you need a hash size >2^27 you may have to set the --mcmodel=medium or -mcmodel=large option in gcc.
E.g.:
	./configure --with-hash-bits=29 CFLAGS='-mcmodel=medium'
